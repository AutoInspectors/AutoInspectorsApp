            There comes a nice little fluffer. In your world you can create anything you desire. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around.
