#Project Pitch

We plan to make an app to use for a vehicle inspection.

#What is the problem you're solving?

Currently inspectors input all of this information on paper and it's later transcribed.  
This can introduce errors due to another person not being able to accurately decipher what has been written.

#What will be your solution to the problem?

Our application allows the inspector to put the information in directly.

#What are the benefits to your solution?

This reduces errors and takes a costly step out of the equation.
