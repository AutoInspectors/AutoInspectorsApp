<h1>Group agreement</h1>

<h2>Communication plan:</h2>

We will do some communication in person but much of it will be on slack due to our remote team member.
This is also good for for ensuring that soft voices are actually heard.

<h2>Conflict plan:</h2>

Our primary means of conflict resolution will be rock-paper-scissors.
The secondary means will be a group discussion and then a vote.
We have a pretty easy going group so we don't anticipate too many major conflicts.

<h2>Work plan:</h2>

We are going to go through our gradng rubric and break this down into user stories and github issues and assign the work and track it using the github issues system.

<h2>Git process:</h2>

We have a rule of no one merging their own stuff solo, especially no weekend or evening merges.
We will meet and go over all changes and merge together.

<h2>Additional items</h2>

We will mostly stay here during the day, but we can work on some work from home as long as we just put in the pull request and don't actually merge.  
Also we want to make sure that people get their work done if they go off sit to complete it.
